	abstract = {In this paper we propose a new family of very efficient hardware oriented block ciphers. The family contains six block ciphers divided into two flavors. All block ciphers share the 80-bit key size and security level. The first flavor, KATAN, is composed of three block ciphers, with 32, 48, or 64-bit block size. The second flavor, KTANTAN, contains the other three ciphers with the same block sizes, and is more compact in hardware, as the key is burnt into the device (and cannot be changed).},

@inproceedings{10.1007/978-3-319-78375-8_22,
	abstract = {A boomerang attack is a cryptanalysis framework that regards a block cipher E as the composition of two sub-ciphers {\$}{\$}E{\_}1{\backslash}circ E{\_}0{\$}{\$}E1∘E0and builds a particular characteristic for E with probability {\$}{\$}p^2q^2{\$}{\$}p2q2by combining differential characteristics for {\$}{\$}E{\_}0{\$}{\$}E0and {\$}{\$}E{\_}1{\$}{\$}E1with probability p and q, respectively. Crucially the validity of this figure is under the assumption that the characteristics for {\$}{\$}E{\_}0{\$}{\$}E0and {\$}{\$}E{\_}1{\$}{\$}E1can be chosen independently. Indeed, Murphy has shown that independently chosen characteristics may turn out to be incompatible. On the other hand, several researchers observed that the probability can be improved to p or q around the boundary between {\$}{\$}E{\_}0{\$}{\$}E0and {\$}{\$}E{\_}1{\$}{\$}E1by considering a positive dependency of the two characteristics, e.g. the ladder switch and S-box switch by Biryukov and Khovratovich. This phenomenon was later formalised by Dunkelman et al. as a sandwich attack that regards E as {\$}{\$}E{\_}1{\backslash}circ E{\_}m {\backslash}circ E{\_}0{\$}{\$}E1∘Em∘E0, where {\$}{\$}E{\_}m{\$}{\$}Emsatisfies some differential propagation among four texts with probability r, and the entire probability is {\$}{\$}p^2q^2r{\$}{\$}p2q2r. In this paper, we revisit the issue of dependency of two characteristics in {\$}{\$}E{\_}m{\$}{\$}Em, and propose a new tool called Boomerang Connectivity Table (BCT), which evaluates r in a systematic and easy-to-understand way when {\$}{\$}E{\_}m{\$}{\$}Emis composed of a single S-box layer. With the BCT, previous observations on the S-box including the incompatibility, the ladder switch and the S-box switch are represented in a unified manner. Moreover, the BCT can detect a new switching effect, which shows that the probability around the boundary may be even higher than p or q. To illustrate the power of the BCT-based analysis, we improve boomerang attacks against Deoxys-BC, and disclose the mechanism behind an unsolved probability amplification for generating a quartet in SKINNY. Lastly, we discuss the issue of searching for S-boxes having good BCT and extending the analysis to modular addition.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a new differential-style attack, which we call the boomerang attack. This attack has several interesting applications. First, we disprove the oft-repeated claim that eliminating all high-probability differentials for the whole cipher is suffcient to guarantee security against differential attacks. Second, we show how to break COCONUT98, a cipher designed using decorrelation techniques to ensure provable security against differential attacks, with an advanced differential-style attack that needs just 216 adaptively chosen texts. Also, to illustrate the power of boomerang techniques, we give new attacks on Khufu-16, FEAL-6, and 16 rounds of CAST-256.},
